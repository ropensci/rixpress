Description: Streamlines the creation of reproducible analytical pipelines using
  'default.nix' expressions generated via the 'rix' package for reproducibility. Define
  derivations in 'R', 'Python' or 'Julia', chain them into a composition of pure
  functions and build the resulting pipeline using 'Nix' as the underlying
  end-to-end build tool. Functions to plot the pipeline as a directed acyclic
  graph are included, as well as functions to load and inspect intermediary results
  for interactive analysis. User experience heavily inspired by the 'targets' package.
