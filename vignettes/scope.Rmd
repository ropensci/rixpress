# Overview

`rixpress` focuses on “micropipelines”: pipelines executed on a single machine
for small-to-medium projects, with reproducible environments via Nix and a
simple, pragmatic user experience from R. This document clarifies what
`rixpress` is and is not, and lays out a short roadmap so users and contributors
can align expectations and proposals.

Key goals:

- Single-machine, small-to-medium pipelines (“micropipelines”).
- Reproducible builds pinned by Nix.
- Simple DAG wiring.
- Polyglot steps where R is first-class, with pragmatic Python/Julia interop.
- CI-friendly (e.g., GitHub Actions) without requiring distributed stacks.

# What `rixpress` is

- A thin, opinionated bridge between R and Nix for building pipelines locally.
- A way to define steps (R / Python / Julia / Quarto/Rmd) as Nix derivations.
- A reproducible mechanism to:
  - parse a DAG from the steps,
  - generate and build a Nix pipeline,
  - store artifacts in the Nix store, and
  - read/load/copy outputs back into R (or interoperate with Python/Julia).

- A “just enough” visualisation layer to inspect the DAG and understand
  dependencies, geared toward small-to-medium graphs.

# What `rixpress` is not

- A distributed workflow engine (no cluster schedulers, no multi-node
  orchestration).
- A long-running workflow daemon, task scheduler, or job server.
- A general-purpose ETL/ELT framework for very large datasets or streaming
  workloads.
- A feature-rich dashboarding / progress-tracking UI.
- A pluggable storage abstraction beyond the Nix store.
- An alternative DSL with complex branching semantics or dynamic targets (beyond
  what Nix + the current design support).

# Primary audience

- R users (and teams) who want strong reproducibility via Nix without leaving R.
- Python users that are not satisfied with current solutions for micropipelines,
  and who are ok with defining the pipeline as an R script.
- Projects that fit on a developer’s workstation or CI runner:
  - Research, analysis, reporting.
  - Model training/evaluation at modest scales.
  - Lightweight ETL on bounded datasets.
- Teams that occasionally mix R steps with Python/Julia, without adopting a
  heavyweight orchestration platform.

# In-scope features (current)

- Define R/Python/Julia/Quarto steps as derivations (`rxp_*()`).
- Generate and build a Nix pipeline (`rxp_populate()`, `rxp_make()`).
- Serialise/deserialise and basic interop (R↔Python/Julia) via common
  formats/APIs.
- Read/load/copy outputs from the Nix store (`rxp_read()`, `rxp_load()`,
  `rxp_copy()`).
- DAG generation and simple visual inspection (local and CI-friendly).
- CI support (GitHub Actions) with cache import/export helpers.

# Out-of-scope features (not planned)

- Cluster execution, distributed scheduling, or remote executors.
- Complex DSLs for branching, runtime expansion, or heavy dynamic targets.
- Pluggable storage backends other than the Nix store.
- High-frequency streaming pipelines, message brokers, or long-running services.
- Large-scale progress servers/dashboards.

But depending on `{rixpress}`'s success and outside contributions, these
features might be implemented sometime in the future.

# Roadmap

This roadmap lists “near-term”, “maybe later”, and “not planned” items to
clarify priorities. Timelines are indicative and may change.

## Near-term (next minor releases)

- Execution of several interconnected pipelines from a single script.

## Maybe later

- Visualisation: Mermaid-first DAG output (portable, text-first), with simple CI
  rendering. Keep a minimal interactive option for large DAGs.
- Lightweight progress summaries: per-derivation timestamps in build logs and
  simple summaries.
- Optional: a separate low-level Nix client package if deeper integrations are
  needed across `rix` and `rixpress`.

## Not planned

- Distributed compute, cluster backends, server-side schedulers.
- Alternative storage engines or backends beyond the Nix store.
- Full-featured dashboards or heavy progress monitoring services.

# How to propose new features

Before filing a feature request, please:

1. Read this scope and roadmap.
2. Check existing issues and discussions.
3. If your request is out-of-scope, consider whether it belongs in:
   - a separate package,
   - an optional companion tool, or
   - a PR to documentation (e.g., “how-to” under current scope).

When you file an issue, please:
- Explain your use case and scale (single machine, data sizes).
- Clarify why the feature belongs in `rixpress` vs. alternatives.
- Suggest a minimal interface that preserves simplicity and reproducibility.
